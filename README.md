# Unity Game Development Project

## Project Overview

This Unity game centers around an engaging objective where player must collect a specified number of swords. Players can achieve this by either trading goods in a shop or gathering raw materials in an immersive forest environment.

## Key Features Implemented

### Forest Environment
- **Design:** Created an immersive forest setting featuring raw materials such as wood, trees, and stones.
- **Resource Gathering:** Players can collect these materials to craft various items within the game.

### Shop System
- **Shop Design:** Developed a shop where players can buy and sell items.
- **Shopkeeper Character:** Introduced a shopkeeper with basic gesture animations to enhance the interactive experience.
- **Transaction Mechanics:** Implemented an inventory system within the shop that handles the buying and selling of objects, reflecting item costs and the player’s available currency.

### Inventory System
- **Inventory Management:** Created a system that allows players to track and manage their items effectively.
- **Economy Integration:** Ensured that the inventory system accurately reflects transactions, maintaining game balance.

### Crafting System
- **Crafting Inventory:** Developed a crafting inventory where players can combine raw materials to create swords and other items.
- **Resource Utilization:** Players use collected materials to craft necessary items, adding strategic depth to the gameplay.

## Learning Outcomes

- **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP):**
  - Mastered coding for an inventory system using OOP principles, including inheritance and polymorphism.
  - Applied OOP concepts to create modular and reusable code, enhancing the game's scalability.

- **Animation Integration:**
  - Learned to add and manage simple animations, such as the shopkeeper’s gestures, to improve the game's visual appeal and user experience.

## Challenges Encountered

- **Sword Placement Issues:**
  - **Problem:** Encountered difficulties with the precise placement of swords when players pressed specific controls.
  
- **Inventory System Errors:**
  - **Problem:** Faced various coding errors while developing the inventory system, which impacted the functionality and stability of the game.
  - **Solution:** Systematically debugged the code to identify and fix errors.

## Conclusion

This project has significantly advanced my skills in Unity game development, particularly in environment design, inventory and crafting systems, and basic animation integration. The challenges encountered provided valuable learning experiences, particularly in debugging and refining game mechanics. This project demonstrates a solid understanding of game development principles and the ability to implement complex systems cohesively and engagingly.
